# Splunk-Network-Forensics-Analysis
This repository hosts the code and documentation for our Splunk-based network forensics analysis project. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive solution for analyzing network traffic data and identifying security incidents using the power of Splunk.

Splunk-Based Network Forensics Analysis Platform
Introduction

This repository hosts the Splunk-based Network Forensics Analysis Platform, designed to integrate with Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for advanced network traffic analysis and incident response. The platform is aligned with the cyber kill chain to enhance the detection and response capabilities against cyber threats.
Features

    IDS Integration: Seamless integration with IDS for capturing and ingesting network traffic into Splunk.
    Advanced Data Analysis: Utilizes Splunk's powerful data processing and analytics capabilities for deep network analysis.
    Cyber Kill Chain Alignment: Custom dashboards and alerts mapped to various stages of the cyber kill chain for effective threat detection.
    Incident Response Playbooks: Detailed response strategies for different types of incidents detected through network analysis.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Splunk Enterprise or Splunk Free version installed.
    Access to an IDS (e.g., Snort, Suricata) for network traffic capture.
    Basic knowledge of Splunk operations and network forensics.

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

    git clone [repository URL]

    Follow the setup instructions in the Installation_Guide.md file.

Usage
