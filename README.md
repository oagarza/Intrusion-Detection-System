# Intrusion-Detection-System
Our project was initiated to tackle the intricate security challenges presented by mesh networks. The goal was to develop an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) tailored to the unique dynamics of these decentralized, wireless environments. By integrating advanced cybersecurity methodologies, we aimed to establish a proactive threat detection mechanism proficient in detecting port scanning in real time.

Mesh networks are known for their robust and adaptable communication features but also introduce a new array of cybersecurity vulnerabilities due to their distributed nature and reliance on wireless connectivity. In response to the growing need for effective security solutions within this context, our project sought to create a sophisticated security framework capable of adapting to and safeguarding against the specific vulnerabilities inherent to mesh networks.

Accomplishments:
1. Research and Development: We conducted comprehensive research to understand the limitations of existing IDS implementations within mesh networks, leading to the creation of a bespoke IDS framework. This framework, developed using Python, supports real-time traffic analysis and effective threat detection.
2. Implementation: Our team successfully deployed the IDS throughout the mesh network, configuring it to monitor a broad spectrum of network ports. We employed packet-capturing libraries such as pcapy and packet inspection tools like Scapy, enabling in-depth traffic analysis.
3. Testing and Validation: The IDS underwent rigorous testing to confirm its efficacy in identifying critical security threats like SYN flood attacks and port scans. Through simulated attacks, we refined the system's algorithms to reduce false positives and enhance its threat response capabilities.

The completion of this project marks a significant achievement in our commitment to network security. The IDS exemplifies our innovative approach and technical expertise, poised for deployment to protect mesh networks against emerging threats. Looking ahead, we plan to enrich the IDS by integrating more advanced AI models and expanding its threat detection capabilities. This continuous effort underscores our dedication to leading edge cybersecurity solutions, ensuring the security and reliability of mesh networks as they expand globally.
